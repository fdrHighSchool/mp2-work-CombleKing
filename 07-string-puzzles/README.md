# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * takes the number of a on a string to the end of the string.

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * takes the part of the string from int a,inclusive,  to int b,exclusive.

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * returns the first instance of a letter wthin a string occuring.

  * `.equals(str)`
    * checks if one string is the same as another string.


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * the for loop will run until i is less than the length string s. the for loop could check every letter within stirng s
